# Terms-of-Servive-of-Vulpo
These are the Terms of Service from the DIscord Bot Vulpo.

Vulpo mainly stores user's ID, server's ID and channel's ID so that users can use certain functions of our bot. And there are some other data that we don't store but display in real time, such as user info and server info.
Vulpo only stores data when you need it for certain functions, such as the ticket system. 
Furthermore, Vulpo does not save data just like that, but only when you use a command, for example to set the ticket system.
The data is not shared with anyone who does not have rights. Only server administrators can do this and also delete the data.
Vulpo stores the user's ID so that it is easy to display his name on the global leaderboards in the game. Secondly, we store the server ID to allow them to use certain features. Finally, Vulpo stores the channel ID so that server administrators can use the bot for greeting messages and other functions.

To request deletion of your data, you must do so in a ticket on the support server.
